This is the new Empire Strikes Back for me. Star Wars has and always will be my favorite franchise, then is The Dark Knight Trilogy. Before watching Dune Part One and Dune Part Two, Middle Earth was my third favorite franchise, now I think Dune is my third favorite duology (hoping franchise in a future). I can't wait for more movies of Dune. The ending was speechless. I need moreeeeee!!!!!! Austin Butler was scary as hell as Feyd the new villain. His portrayal was phenomenal as Elvis. And Timothee Challamet as Paul Artreides, was spectacular. The new Anakin Skywalker (the chosen one) aka Darth Vader. This movie is in my Top 5 favorite film in history. It is epic, intense, sometimes dark. It is like Star Wars. If you're a Star Wars fan, you're going to enjoy this film. The fights were epic. The dialogue, acting, cinematography, visual effects, were phenomenal. I've seen it twice in theaters and it's very long but enjoyable, for me the duration of the movie is just 30 minutes. I saw it on IMAX and is a must see on the big screen. Highly recommend this film on IMAX.\",\n          \"The scenery, the costumes, the performances of some the actors are excellent. However, past the few elements that makes watching the movie not a complete waste of time, but not something you're really satisfied with, glaring weaknesses remain.\\n\\nIt's too often over-dramatic. It makes copious use of the same boring and easy techniques to create superficial drama: the zoom-in on characters, taking an embarrassing heroic pose or looking deeply intense with determined eyes and a slight frown.\\n\\nOh, and the shouting! Characters and crowd shouting ad nauseam the same mantras as if to make us, simpletons, understand basic concepts by repeating them three, four, five times. We got it. Move on! Done and seen a thousand times elsewhere.\\n\\nOn that subject, this movie is very loud. In every sense of the word. Sometimes the actors shout for no apparent reason other than to convey to the public that they're saying something important. Thing is, it actually has the opposite effect. It's like a child throwing a tantrum, demanding to be heard. Then, there's the action scenes. Oh my, did they overdo them. It's constant blasting and fighting. The fast food of the movie industry. The louder the better. Explosions, fast camera movements, noise all around as if the void of the script needed to be filled at all time with visual stunts so that you don't have to think too hard about the story.\\n\\nIt follows that the dialogues are weak, really weak. If one isolated the words and read them they'd be appalled by the sheer stupidity and shallowness of some of the lines. And obviously, it would look completely ridiculous compared to the book.\\n\\nAll in all, this is just a mass market product that has some moments but that is plagued by the necessity to appeal to everyone and places the bar for that everyone very low. It does not expect much from itself or from its audience and so you leave the theater wondering what was the point.\",\n          \"Finally a necessary sequel that surpasses the original on a huge scale.\\n\\nA masterclass in filmmaking by Denis Villeneuve, who effortlessly brings the complex universe of Dune to life. The storytelling is a brilliant tapestry of intrigue, seamlessly blending intricate plotlines and character arcs.\\n\\nThe cinematography is a visual feast, with beautiful desert landscapes that transport the audience to Arrakis itself. The ensemble cast, led by Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, breathes life into each character, creating a captivating on-screen chemistry.\\n\\nFurthermore, the music score, composed by Hans Zimmer elevates the entire experience, perfectly complimenting the grandeur of the narrative.\\n\\nDune part 2 is a cinematic triumph, a symphony of talent converging to deliver a truly unforgettable masterpiece of cinema history.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_review\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"what masterpiec thi new empir strike back star war alway favorit franchis the dark knight trilog befor watch dune part one dune part two middl earth third favorit franchis i think dune third favorit duolog hope franchis futur i cant wait movi dune the end speechless i need moreeeee austin butler scari hell feyd new villain hi portray phenomen elvi and timothe challamet paul artreid spectacular the new anakin skywalk chosen one aka darth vader thi movi top favorit film histori it epic intens sometim dark it like star war if your star war fan your go enjoy film the fight epic the dialogu act cinematographi visual effect phenomen ive seen twice theater long enjoy durat movi minut i saw imax must see big screen highli recommend film imax\",\n          \"the sceneri costum perform actor excel howev past element make watch movi complet wast time someth your realli satisfi glare weak remain it often overdramat it make copiou use bore easi techniqu creat superfici drama zoomin charact take embarrass heroic pose look deepli intens determin eye slight frown oh shout charact crowd shout ad nauseam mantra make u simpleton understand basic concept repeat three four five time we got move done seen thousand time elsewher on subject movi loud in everi sen word sometim actor shout appar reason convey public theyr say someth import thing actual opposit effect it like child throw tantrum demand heard then there action scene oh overdo it constant blast fight the fast food movi industri the louder better explos fast camera movement nois around void script need fill time visual stunt dont think hard stori it follow dialogu weak realli weak if one isol word read theyd appal sheer stupid shallow line and obvious would look complet ridicul compar book all mass market product moment plagu necess appeal everyon place bar everyon low it expect much audienc leav theater wonder point\",\n          \"final necessari sequel surpass origin huge scale a masterclass filmmak deni villeneuv effortlessli bring complex univers dune life the storytel brilliant tapestri intrigu seamlessli blend intric plotlin charact arc the cinematographi visual feast beauti desert landscap transport audienc arraki the ensembl cast led timothe chalamet zendaya breath life charact creat captiv onscreen chemistri furthermor music score compos han zimmer elev entir experi perfectli compliment grandeur narr dune part cinemat triumph symphoni talent converg deliv truli unforgett masterpiec cinema histori\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This is the new Empire Strikes Back for me. Star Wars has and always will be my favorite franchise, then is The Dark Knight Trilogy. Before watching Dune Part One and Dune Part Two, Middle Earth was my third favorite franchise, now I think Dune is my third favorite duology (hoping franchise in a future). I can't wait for more movies of Dune. The ending was speechless. I need moreeeeee!!!!!! Austin Butler was scary as hell as Feyd the new villain. His portrayal was phenomenal as Elvis. And Timothee Challamet as Paul Artreides, was spectacular. The new Anakin Skywalker (the chosen one) aka Darth Vader. This movie is in my Top 5 favorite film in history. It is epic, intense, sometimes dark. It is like Star Wars. If you're a Star Wars fan, you're going to enjoy this film. The fights were epic. The dialogue, acting, cinematography, visual effects, were phenomenal. I've seen it twice in theaters and it's very long but enjoyable, for me the duration of the movie is just 30 minutes. I saw it on IMAX and is a must see on the big screen. Highly recommend this film on IMAX.\",\n          \"The scenery, the costumes, the performances of some the actors are excellent. However, past the few elements that makes watching the movie not a complete waste of time, but not something you're really satisfied with, glaring weaknesses remain.\\n\\nIt's too often over-dramatic. It makes copious use of the same boring and easy techniques to create superficial drama: the zoom-in on characters, taking an embarrassing heroic pose or looking deeply intense with determined eyes and a slight frown.\\n\\nOh, and the shouting! Characters and crowd shouting ad nauseam the same mantras as if to make us, simpletons, understand basic concepts by repeating them three, four, five times. We got it. Move on! Done and seen a thousand times elsewhere.\\n\\nOn that subject, this movie is very loud. In every sense of the word. Sometimes the actors shout for no apparent reason other than to convey to the public that they're saying something important. Thing is, it actually has the opposite effect. It's like a child throwing a tantrum, demanding to be heard. Then, there's the action scenes. Oh my, did they overdo them. It's constant blasting and fighting. The fast food of the movie industry. The louder the better. Explosions, fast camera movements, noise all around as if the void of the script needed to be filled at all time with visual stunts so that you don't have to think too hard about the story.\\n\\nIt follows that the dialogues are weak, really weak. If one isolated the words and read them they'd be appalled by the sheer stupidity and shallowness of some of the lines. And obviously, it would look completely ridiculous compared to the book.\\n\\nAll in all, this is just a mass market product that has some moments but that is plagued by the necessity to appeal to everyone and places the bar for that everyone very low. It does not expect much from itself or from its audience and so you leave the theater wondering what was the point.\",\n          \"Finally a necessary sequel that surpasses the original on a huge scale.\\n\\nA masterclass in filmmaking by Denis Villeneuve, who effortlessly brings the complex universe of Dune to life. The storytelling is a brilliant tapestry of intrigue, seamlessly blending intricate plotlines and character arcs.\\n\\nThe cinematography is a visual feast, with beautiful desert landscapes that transport the audience to Arrakis itself. The ensemble cast, led by Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, breathes life into each character, creating a captivating on-screen chemistry.\\n\\nFurthermore, the music score, composed by Hans Zimmer elevates the entire experience, perfectly complimenting the grandeur of the narrative.\\n\\nDune part 2 is a cinematic triumph, a symphony of talent converging to deliver a truly unforgettable masterpiece of cinema history.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_review\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"what masterpiec thi new empir strike back star war alway favorit franchis the dark knight trilog befor watch dune part one dune part two middl earth third favorit franchis i think dune third favorit duolog hope franchis futur i cant wait movi dune the end speechless i need moreeeee austin butler scari hell feyd new villain hi portray phenomen elvi and timothe challamet paul artreid spectacular the new anakin skywalk chosen one aka darth vader thi movi top favorit film histori it epic intens sometim dark it like star war if your star war fan your go enjoy film the fight epic the dialogu act cinematographi visual effect phenomen ive seen twice theater long enjoy durat movi minut i saw imax must see big screen highli recommend film imax\",\n          \"the sceneri costum perform actor excel howev past element make watch movi complet wast time someth your realli satisfi glare weak remain it often overdramat it make copiou use bore easi techniqu creat superfici drama zoomin charact take embarrass heroic pose look deepli intens determin eye slight frown oh shout charact crowd shout ad nauseam mantra make u simpleton understand basic concept repeat three four five time we got move done seen thousand time elsewher on subject movi loud in everi sen word sometim actor shout appar reason convey public theyr say someth import thing actual opposit effect it like child throw tantrum demand heard then there action scene oh overdo it constant blast fight the fast food movi industri the louder better explos fast camera movement nois around void script need fill time visual stunt dont think hard stori it follow dialogu weak realli weak if one isol word read theyd appal sheer stupid shallow line and obvious would look complet ridicul compar book all mass market product moment plagu necess appeal everyon place bar everyon low it expect much audienc leav theater wonder point\",\n          \"final necessari sequel surpass origin huge scale a masterclass filmmak deni villeneuv effortlessli bring complex univers dune life the storytel brilliant tapestri intrigu seamlessli blend intric plotlin charact arc the cinematographi visual feast beauti desert landscap transport audienc arraki the ensembl cast led timothe chalamet zendaya breath life charact creat captiv onscreen chemistri furthermor music score compos han zimmer elev entir experi perfectli compliment grandeur narr dune part cinemat triumph symphoni talent converg deliv truli unforgett masterpiec cinema histori\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"NOUN\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 24,\n        \"min\": 10,\n        \"max\": 256,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 107,\n        \"samples\": [\n          215,\n          27,\n          25\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"VERB\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 11,\n        \"min\": 3,\n        \"max\": 177,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 55,\n        \"samples\": [\n          37,\n          8,\n          23\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ADJ\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 114,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56,\n        \"samples\": [\n          54,\n          13,\n          33\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ADV\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 51,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 24,\n        \"samples\": [\n          9,\n          12,\n          20\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Before watching Dune Part One and Dune Part Two, Middle Earth was my third favorite franchise, now I think Dune is my third favorite duology (hoping franchise in a future). I can't wait for more movies of Dune. The ending was speechless. I need moreeeeee!!!!!! Austin Butler was scary as hell as Feyd the new villain. His portrayal was phenomenal as Elvis. And Timothee Challamet as Paul Artreides, was spectacular. The new Anakin Skywalker (the chosen one) aka Darth Vader. This movie is in my Top 5 favorite film in history. It is epic, intense, sometimes dark. It is like Star Wars. If you're a Star Wars fan, you're going to enjoy this film. The fights were epic. The dialogue, acting, cinematography, visual effects, were phenomenal. I've seen it twice in theaters and it's very long but enjoyable, for me the duration of the movie is just 30 minutes. I saw it on IMAX and is a must see on the big screen. Highly recommend this film on IMAX.\",\n          \"The scenery, the costumes, the performances of some the actors are excellent. However, past the few elements that makes watching the movie not a complete waste of time, but not something you're really satisfied with, glaring weaknesses remain.\\n\\nIt's too often over-dramatic. It makes copious use of the same boring and easy techniques to create superficial drama: the zoom-in on characters, taking an embarrassing heroic pose or looking deeply intense with determined eyes and a slight frown.\\n\\nOh, and the shouting! Characters and crowd shouting ad nauseam the same mantras as if to make us, simpletons, understand basic concepts by repeating them three, four, five times. We got it. Move on! Done and seen a thousand times elsewhere.\\n\\nOn that subject, this movie is very loud. In every sense of the word. Sometimes the actors shout for no apparent reason other than to convey to the public that they're saying something important. Thing is, it actually has the opposite effect. It's like a child throwing a tantrum, demanding to be heard. Then, there's the action scenes. Oh my, did they overdo them. It's constant blasting and fighting. The fast food of the movie industry. The louder the better. Explosions, fast camera movements, noise all around as if the void of the script needed to be filled at all time with visual stunts so that you don't have to think too hard about the story.\\n\\nIt follows that the dialogues are weak, really weak. If one isolated the words and read them they'd be appalled by the sheer stupidity and shallowness of some of the lines. And obviously, it would look completely ridiculous compared to the book.\\n\\nAll in all, this is just a mass market product that has some moments but that is plagued by the necessity to appeal to everyone and places the bar for that everyone very low. It does not expect much from itself or from its audience and so you leave the theater wondering what was the point.\",\n          \"Finally a necessary sequel that surpasses the original on a huge scale.\\n\\nA masterclass in filmmaking by Denis Villeneuve, who effortlessly brings the complex universe of Dune to life. The storytelling is a brilliant tapestry of intrigue, seamlessly blending intricate plotlines and character arcs.\\n\\nThe cinematography is a visual feast, with beautiful desert landscapes that transport the audience to Arrakis itself. The ensemble cast, led by Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, breathes life into each character, creating a captivating on-screen chemistry.\\n\\nFurthermore, the music score, composed by Hans Zimmer elevates the entire experience, perfectly complimenting the grandeur of the narrative.\\n\\nDune part 2 is a cinematic triumph, a symphony of talent converging to deliver a truly unforgettable masterpiece of cinema history.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_review\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

        "#### I really liked doing webscrapping using selenium and beautiful soap. By working on different questions I was able to learn a lot on both the methods. The questions this time are really great and there was sufficient time to solve them. In next assignments maybe working on LLM's would be really great. I worked on preprocessing of numerical data, but this is the first time working on text data. Finding POS and NER tags in sentences was exciting. Dependency and constituency parsing was a bit hard to understand. I wonder whether the tagging is correct or not? Anyways, by doing first 3 questions without using AI gave a lot of Knowledge. By doing the twitter Question now I am confident of using API to fetch data, as i had to go through a lot of documentation to find the right parameters. Overall This is ONE OF THE BEST ASSIGNMENT I have done in a while."
